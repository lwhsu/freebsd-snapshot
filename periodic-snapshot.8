.Sh NAME
.Nm periodic-snapshot
.Nd run periodic UFS/ZFS backup snapshot maintenance task
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is intended to be called by
.Xr cron 8
to create and expire UFS/ZFS backup snapshots
through the
.Xr snapshot 8
command according to the
.Va snapshot_enable
and 
.Va snapshot_schedule
settings from
.Xr periodic.conf 5 .
.Pp
The system
.Pa /etc/crontab
will typically have entries for
.Nm
similar to the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# do hourly/daily/weekly maintenance of FreeBSD UFS/ZFS snapshots
0  *  *  *  *  root  periodic-snapshot hourly
0  0  *  *  *  root  periodic-snapshot daily
0  0  *  *  0  root  periodic-snapshot weekly
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
system registry will typically contain the following defaults which keep
.Nm 
disabled by default:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snapshot_enable="NO"
snapshot_schedule=""
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va snapshot_schedule
variable values have to conform to the following grammar:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<schedule>    ::= <entry>*
<entry>       ::= <fs> ("," <fs>)* ":" <spec>
<fs>          ::= /^\/.*$/
<spec>        ::= <gen_weekly> ":" <gen_daily> ":" <gen_hourly>
<gen_weekly>  ::= <generation>
<gen_daily>   ::= <generation>
<gen_hourly>  ::= <generation> ("@" <hour> ("," <hour>)*)?
<generation>  ::= /^[0-9]+$/
<hour>        ::= /^(0?[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3])$/
.Ed
.Pp
The number of all added "generation" numbers of a filesystem cannot be larger
than 20 because this is the maximum number of snapshots which can be
created on a UFS/ZFS filesystem. A "generation" number of "0" disables
the creation of backup snapshots.
.Pp
The used schedule heavily depends on how much generations of snapshots
should be kept, which in turn depends on how much disk space is available.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf"
.It Pa /etc/crontab
the
.Nm
utility is typically called via entries in the system default
.Xr cron 8
table.
.It Pa /etc/defaults/periodic.conf
system registry containing variables that control the behaviour of
.Nm .
.It Pa /etc/periodic.conf
this file contains local overrides for the default
.Nm
configuration.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In order to configure UFS/ZFS backup snapshot creation, add
lines to
.Pa /etc/periodic.conf
similar to:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snapshot_enable="YES"
snapshot_schedule="/,/usr:2:1:0 /var:0:2:4 /home:2:6:8@8,12,16,20"
.Ed
.Pp
This schedules the following UFS/ZFS backup snapshots: 2 weekly
(weekly.[01]) and 1 daily (daily.0) generation of snapshots on
the / and /usr filesystems, two daily (daily.[01]) and 4 hourly
(hourly.[0123]) generations of snapshots on the /var filesystem,
and 2 weekly (weekly.[01]), 6 daily (daily.[0123456]) and 8 hourly
(hourly.[01234567]) generations of snapshots on the /home filesystem.
While the hourly snapshots on /var are created every hour, the hourly
snapshots on /home are created on 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 only.
